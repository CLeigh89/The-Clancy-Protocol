Emotional logistics, creative AI scaffolding, and digital systems for human-centered decision-making.
# The Clancy Protocol

**The Clancy Protocol** is a framework for designing systems of emotional logistics, digital sovereignty, and creative infrastructure. Built by and for women in transition, it translates trauma-informed insight and artistic process into scalable, tech-enabled models.

### 🔧 What This Is
A hybrid methodology combining:
- AI scaffolding (prompt design, emotional modeling, systems logic)
- Mental health-informed UX
- Creative entrepreneurship + automation
- Self-governed archiving and legacy mapping

### 💡 Why It Matters
Because women in survival mode need tools that are *strategic, poetic, and precise* — not just inspirational. Because emotional clarity should scale. Because legacy deserves infrastructure.

### 📌 Use Cases
- AI-integrated tools for mental wellness
- Digital mobility systems (Nomadic tech kits, font licensing, sovereign work models)
- Modular content protocols for Notion, GitHub, and CRM alignment
- Workshops for women creatives, community builders, and technologists
